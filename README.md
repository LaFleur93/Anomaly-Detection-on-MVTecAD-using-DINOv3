## Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection and Anomaly Segmentation using DINOv3 embeddings

This work intends to show the performance and potential of DINOv3 for both anomaly detection and anomaly segmentation on the industrial dataset MVTec-AD.

The Jupyter Notebook file explains all the steps on how to get to performance metrics for both image-level and pixel-level analysis.

All the functions are imported from "functions.py".
